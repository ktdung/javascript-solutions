// Exercise 3-2
// ------------

// NO MODIFICATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE EXERCISE FOLDER (i.e. the css is read-only)

// Hint:
// create a toggleColor function
// Because we are now going to work with the opacity and background of the buttons,
// they need to be set here. So that they are referenceable via the the style attribute.
// initialize the background color for all of the buttons in here. (for loop)
